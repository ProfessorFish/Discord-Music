# Discord-Music
A simple music bot made with pure discord.js v13 and no outside packages

**TO USE:**

(This assumes you have nodejs installed, if you do not then what are you doing.)

1. Download files
2. Unzip
3. Open /Functions/Start/BootUp.js
4. Replace process.env.TOKEN with your token in a string (e.g. "BOT_TOKEN"), you can get the token of the bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
5.  Replace 825406975545442325 with your bot ID.
6. Install packages and run index.js either via an IDE like VSCode or via command line using the following commands:
7. cd FILE_DIRECTORY
8. npm i
9. node index.js
10. If all goes well, the bot should turn online and be responsive to command with the prefix ?. To change the prefix, go into /Functions/Start/BootUp.js and change it there along with a few other things.

**NOTE:**

If your bot is just going to run in one server, then go to /Functions/Start/AddCommands.js line 36 and un-note the line, then note the code on line 37
