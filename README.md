# Discord-Music
A simple music bot made with pure discord.js v13 and no outside packages

**TO USE:**

(This assumes you have nodejs installed, if you do not then what are you doing.)

1. Download files
2. Unzip
3. Open /Functions/Start/ClientLogin.js
4. Replace process.env.TOKEN with your token in a string (e.g. "BOT_TOKEN"), you can get the token of the bot in the (Discord Developer Portal)[https://discord.com/developers/applications]
5. Run index.js either via an IDE like VSCode or via command line using the following commands:
6. cd FILE_DIRECTORY
7. node index.js
8. If all goes well, the bot should turn online and be responsive to command with the prefix ?. To change the prefix, go into /Functions/Start/AddConfig.js and change it there along with a few other things.
